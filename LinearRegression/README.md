## Linear Regression
This is the code for 'Linear Regression - Giving Best Fit Line' post by Piyush Malhotra on codeflaunt.wordpress.com

### Overview
This is the code for [this](https://codeflaunt.wordpress.com/2017/03/09/linear-regression-giving-best-fit-line) blog post by Piyush Malhotra.I'm using a small dataset of student test scores and the amount of hours they studied. Intuitively, we can think of a relationship between them. Like, the more you study the more you score. Method used here is [Linear Regression using Gradient Descent](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/06/24/gradient-descent-linear-regression/).

## Dependencies
-numpy
Python 2 or 3 both work just fine. Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the dependencies.

## Usage 
Run gradientDescent.py to see the result.
