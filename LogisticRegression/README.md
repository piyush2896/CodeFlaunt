## Logistic Regression
This is the code for 'Linear Regression - Giving Best Fit Line' post by Piyush Malhotra on codeflaunt.wordpress.com

### Overview
This is the code for [this](https://codeflaunt.wordpress.com/2017/04/14/logistic-regression-hands-on-experience) blog post by Piyush Malhotra.I'm using a small dataset of 'gpa', 'gre marks', 'college rank' and 'admit to student'. Intuitively, we can think of a relationship between them, like admit provided to student by college being dependent on first three. Method used here is Gradient Descent.

## Dependencies
-NumPy - Numerical Manipulation Library for Python

-Pandas - for data extraction

Python 2 or 3 both work just fine. 

Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the dependencies.

## Usage 
Run logistic_regression.py to see the result.
